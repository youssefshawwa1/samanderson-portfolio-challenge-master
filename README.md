# Sam Anderson Portfolio Challenge

## Context
Sam Anderson has been working as a Graphic Designer in London for several years. He now plans to expand his work in and outside London by having a web presence that showcases his work. Sam has already designed the layout of his web page but needs help in scripting the markups and styles to realize the design.​

## Problem Statement
Sam had assigned this work to a local FrontEnd Developer, but the developer had some challenges and unfortunately could only produce the markup. Sam now needs help in styling the web page such that it gives a great user-experience to attract his customers.​

Style a web page available in `./index.html` to make it better readable and looks more attractive.​ **Sam wants his Portfolio to resemble the image given below.**
